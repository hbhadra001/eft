Purpose
We provide a standardized, secure, and auditable platform to move files between internal systems and external partners. The platform enables self‑service onboarding, policy‑as‑code guardrails, and end‑to‑end observability to reduce onboarding time from [X days] to [Y hours] while satisfying [SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / HIPAA / PCI DSS / GDPR] controls.

Scope
This architecture covers:

Transfer endpoints via AWS Transfer Family (SFTP/FTPS/FTP) and Amazon S3 (primary data store).

Orchestration using AWS Step Functions and EventBridge, with optional Lambda/Fargate for validation, routing, and lightweight transforms.

Observability with CloudWatch metrics and logs, CloudTrail, and S3 access logs.

Key management with AWS KMS ([single‑Region / multi‑Region keys]).

Environments: [Dev/Test/Prod] across [primary region] and [secondary region] with [active‑active / active‑passive] DR.

In Scope Transfer Patterns

SFTP → S3 (Ingress): Partners push files to managed SFTP; files land in S3 landing bucket.

S3 → SFTP (Egress): Internal systems drop to S3; platform delivers to partner SFTP.

S3 → S3: Intra‑/cross‑account and cross‑region replication and delivery.

SFTP → SFTP via S3: Bridge pattern using S3 as durable hop.

Optional: On‑prem → S3 via AWS DataSync.

Service Levels (Targets)

Availability [99.9%+] per region; [failover method] for regional incidents.

Median processing [<60s], P95 [<2m] from arrival to durable storage.

Throughput [≥N concurrent transfers; ≥X TB/day].

Integrity: SHA‑256 checksum verified; retries with exponential backoff; idempotent writes.

RTO [30 min], RPO [≤15 min] (data plane RPO 0 with S3 CRR where enabled).

Support: [24×7 / business hours] with L1 response [<15 min], L2 triage [<60 min].

Compliance & Governance

Encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest (SSE‑S3/SSE‑KMS).

IAM least‑privilege roles, SCPs, and VPC endpoints/PrivateLink for private access.

Audit via CloudTrail and S3 access logs (retention [N days/months]).

Retention & purge via S3 lifecycle per data class.

Data residency enforced ([policy link]).

Out of Scope
Application‑level EDI mapping, heavy ETL, streaming, and ad‑hoc person‑to‑person sharing.

Assumptions & Constraints
Partners support modern SFTP ciphers; max file size [X GB]; file naming [{tenant}/{workflow}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hhmmss}_{uuid}.dat].

Success Metrics
Onboarding lead time, auto‑remediation rate, MTTR, compliance incidents (zero), and $/GB.
