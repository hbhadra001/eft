# Enterprise File Transfer (EFT) â€” Executive Summary

**Date:** {today}
**Status:** Draft for Architecture Review
**Owners:** Platform Engineering / Data Engineering

---

## 1. Purpose

This document provides an **executive overview** of the Enterprise File Transfer (EFT) platform.
It outlines the **business drivers**, **goals**, **non-goals**, and the **expected outcomes** of the initiative.
The content is intended for the Architecture Review Committee, executives, and stakeholders evaluating readiness for production.

---

## 2. Context

Enterprises need a **secure, scalable, and compliant file transfer platform** to manage partner integrations.
Current solutions are fragmented, require manual onboarding, and lack observability.
EFT will consolidate these workflows into a **single, self-service platform** on AWS.

---

## 3. Goals

* **Self-Service Partner Onboarding**
  Partners/tenants can define transfer routes, delivery targets, and transforms through UI/API.

* **Secure & Compliant Transfers**
  End-to-end encryption (at rest/in transit), audit trails, and compliance with SOC2/ISO27001.

* **Reliability & Scale**
  Handle thousands of jobs daily with predictable latency, strong idempotency, and backpressure controls.

* **Observability & Notifications**
  Dashboards, logs, and SNS notifications for job status, errors, and SLAs.

* **Resilience & DR**
  Active-Active strategy with **S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**, **DynamoDB Global Tables**, and **Route53 failover**.
  Target RPO = 0, RTO < 15 minutes.

---

## 4. Non-Goals

* Building a custom SFTP service (we leverage AWS Transfer Family).
* Developing a proprietary messaging bus (we use SQS/SNS).
* Custom IAM/SSO implementation (we integrate with AWS IAM + future Cognito/SSO).
* Deep analytics or ML enrichment (future phase, not in current scope).

---

## 5. Outcomes

* **Unified EFT Platform**: One standardized solution for all inbound/outbound file transfers.
* **Reduced Operational Overhead**: No manual partner provisioning; everything via IaC and APIs.
* **Improved Partner Experience**: Faster onboarding, predictable delivery, proactive notifications.
* **Audit & Compliance Ready**: Full traceability via CloudTrail, DDB job records, and structured logging.
* **Future-Proof Architecture**: Extensible for transforms, analytics, and partner-specific workflows.

---

## 6. Success Metrics

* Onboarding a new partner route in < 1 day.
* â‰¥ 99.9% availability across 30 days.
* P95 end-to-end job latency â‰¤ 10 minutes (â‰¤ 2GB files).
* Zero data loss (S3 durability + CRR).
* 100% of jobs logged and traceable via DDB.

---

## 7. Next Steps

* Validate architecture with pilot tenants.
* Execute DR drills to confirm Active-Active readiness.
* Prepare Ops playbooks for monitoring and troubleshooting.
* Committee approval to proceed with Production rollout.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also generate this as a **Confluence-ready Word document (.docx)** so you can directly upload/import it into your space instead of copy-pasting Markdown?
