Got it üëç I‚Äôll create a professional **Root Cause Analysis (RCA) document** for the File Transfer Failure in ABC production. I‚Äôll use a structured RCA template that your leadership, architecture review board, or incident management team would expect.

# **Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Document**

**Incident Title:** File Transfer Failure ‚Äì ABC Production Environment
**Date of Incident:** \[Insert Date]
**Prepared By:** \[Your Name / Team]
**Environment:** ABC Production
**Impacted Systems:** NNNIIISSS ‚Üí NNNYYYY Servers

---

## **1. Executive Summary**

On **\[Date, Time in UTC/PST]**, file transfer jobs between **NNNIIISSS** and **NNNYYYY** servers in the **ABC production environment** failed due to an **incorrect private key configuration**. The private key used during the authentication handshake did not match the corresponding public key configured on the target NNNYYYY servers, preventing successful Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) session establishment.

This caused multiple file transfer jobs to fail, resulting in delayed downstream processing and potential SLA breaches.

## **3. Timeline of Events**

| Time (UTC/PST) | Event Description                                                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \[HH\:MM]      | File transfer job initiated from NNNIIISSS to NNNYYYY servers.              |
| \[HH\:MM]      | Authentication failure error logged: *"Permission denied (publickey)"*.     |
| \[HH\:MM]      | Multiple retries attempted; all failed.                                     |
| \[HH\:MM]      | Incident detected by monitoring alerts (CloudWatch/Splunk/Monitoring Tool). |
| \[HH\:MM]      | Incident escalated to File Transfer Ops Team.                               |
| \[HH\:MM]      | Root cause identified: Incorrect private key deployed on NNNIIISSS.         |
| \[HH\:MM]      | Correct private key reconfigured and tested.                                |
| \[HH\:MM]      | File transfers resumed successfully. Incident resolved.                     |

## **4. Root Cause**

* The **private key** deployed on **NNNIIISSS** for authentication with **NNNYYYY** was not the correct version.
* Likely causes include:

  * Incorrect key uploaded during recent configuration update.
  * Lack of automated validation between private key and corresponding public key on target.
  * Configuration management gap: no checksum or key verification before deployment.

---

## **5. Corrective Actions Taken**

1. Verified authentication failure logs on NNNIIISSS.
2. Retrieved correct private key from secure key vault.
3. Updated configuration with correct private key on NNNIIISSS.
4. Validated connectivity via test SFTP session.
5. Re-ran failed file transfer jobs successfully.

## **6. Preventive / Long-Term Actions**

| Action Item                                                                                                     | Owner             | Target Date | Status  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Implement automated **key validation checks** (ensure private key matches target public key before deployment). | File Transfer Ops | \[Date]     | Pending |
| Store and manage all SSH keys in a **centralized Key Management Service (KMS/Secrets Manager)**.                | Security Team     | \[Date]     | Pending |
| Update **runbooks** with explicit validation steps during key rotation.                                         | Ops Team          | \[Date]     | Pending |
| Enhance **monitoring/alerting** to immediately detect authentication failures with enriched error context.      | Monitoring Team   | \[Date]     | Pending |
| Conduct **training session** for operations engineers on secure key management practices.                       | Security Lead     | \[Date]     | Pending |

## **7. Lessons Learned**

* Authentication-related failures can cause prolonged outages if not detected quickly.
* Keys should never be manually uploaded without automated validation.
* Centralized management of keys reduces risk of configuration drift.
* End-to-end monitoring should not only detect job failures but also classify **failure types** (network, authentication, permission, etc.) for faster RCA.

---

## **8. Incident Severity & Classification**

* **Severity:** High (Business-critical file transfers impacted).
* **Incident Category:** Authentication / Configuration Error.
* **Status:** Closed after resolution and validation.

‚úÖ This RCA is structured so you can directly paste into **Confluence / RCA Tracker**.

Would you like me to also create a **downloadable Confluence-ready Word/PDF** version with proper formatting, tables, and sections for circulation to stakeholders?
