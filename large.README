## **Invention Title**

**Serverless Framework for Large File Transfer and Processing using AWS Lambda with Dynamic Chaining and Chunked Streaming**

## **Background / Problem Statement**

Traditional file-transfer and ETL frameworks rely on persistent compute (EC2, batch servers, or container jobs) to move or process large files over SFTP, limiting scalability and increasing cost.
AWS Lambda provides a scalable serverless runtime, but its **15-minute execution limit and memory constraints** make it unsuitable for transferring files larger than a few hundred MBs.
Existing solutions require complex orchestration (Step Functions, DataSync) or external compute, increasing maintenance overhead.

There is a clear need for a **purely serverless, scalable, resumable, and fault-tolerant mechanism** to transfer **multi-GB (10GB+)** files securely to and from SFTP endpoints inside private VPCs.

---

## **Summary of the Invention**

This invention introduces a **Lambda-based adaptive transfer framework** that enables **large file uploads and downloads over SFTP** entirely within AWS Lambda constraints.
The system intelligently divides data into configurable chunks and uses self-invoking Lambdas to complete large transfers seamlessly.

### **Core Innovations**

1. **Lambda Chaining Mechanism**

   * Each invocation transfers a fixed byte range (chunk).
   * Before timeout, Lambda self-invokes asynchronously to continue the transfer from the last checkpoint.
   * Enables continuous processing of arbitrarily large files (>10 GB) within a stateless serverless architecture.

2. **Chunked Streaming via Paramiko**

   * Uses Paramiko’s `file()` streaming APIs for incremental upload/write operations.
   * Supports pipelined writes and manual checkpointing to ensure resumability without retransfer.

3. **Secure Private VPC Integration**

   * Lambda runs in a private subnet and connects directly to AWS Transfer Family SFTP endpoints inside the VPC.
   * Supports host key fingerprint validation and encrypted key handling (from S3, Secrets Manager, or inline KMS-decrypted strings).

4. **Resumable and Fault-Tolerant Design**

   * Maintains state (offset, chunk size, total size) in event payload or DynamoDB.
   * If a failure occurs mid-transfer, the next invocation resumes automatically.

5. **Atomic Completion using Rename Semantics**

   * Uploads to temporary “`.part`” files and performs atomic `rename()` to finalize—ensuring destination integrity and zero-downtime handoff.

6. **Self-Serve Automation Potential**

   * Framework supports dynamic JSON-based configuration, allowing customers or teams to onboard new SFTP workflows without manual coding.

## **Advantages Over Existing Solutions**

| Existing Method    | Drawbacks                                              | New Framework Benefit                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| EC2 / Batch jobs   | Always-on, high cost                                   | 100 % serverless, pay-per-use                       |
| AWS DataSync       | Limited extensibility, costly for small/irregular jobs | Fully customizable and event-driven                 |
| Standard Lambda    | Limited to ~500 MB due to 15-min runtime               | Breaks runtime barrier via chaining and checkpoints |
| Custom FTP clients | Require manual restart on failure                      | Automatic resume and retry with durable state       |

## **Potential Applications**

* Secure data ingestion from partner SFTP servers into S3 data lakes.
* Enterprise self-serve onboarding of file-transfer workflows.
* Automated large-file exports from AWS systems to on-prem partners.
* Hybrid AI/ETL pipelines where files trigger downstream analytics via EventBridge.

---

## **Implementation Environment**

* **AWS Services:** Lambda (Python 3.12), Transfer Family, S3, DynamoDB, EventBridge, Secrets Manager
* **Language/Libraries:** Python (Paramiko, Boto3)
* **Deployment:** Terraform or CloudFormation module with IAM least-privilege roles and optional VPC endpoints.

## **Example Claim (for Patent Review)**

> A method for performing secure, large-scale file transfers using serverless functions, comprising:
> (a) initiating an AWS Lambda instance that transfers a defined byte range of a file over SFTP;
> (b) detecting an approaching runtime threshold and asynchronously invoking a subsequent Lambda instance with updated state;
> (c) repeating steps (a)–(b) until completion; and
> (d) atomically renaming a temporary file to finalize the transfer, thereby enabling uninterrupted multi-GB file movement within a stateless serverless framework.
