## **Invention Title**

**Serverless Framework for Large File Transfer and Processing using AWS Lambda with Dynamic Chaining and Chunked Streaming**

## **Background / Problem Statement**

Traditional file-transfer and ETL frameworks rely on persistent compute (EC2, batch servers, or container jobs) to move or process large files over SFTP, limiting scalability and increasing cost.
AWS Lambda provides a scalable serverless runtime, but its **15-minute execution limit and memory constraints** make it unsuitable for transferring files larger than a few hundred MBs.
Existing solutions require complex orchestration (Step Functions, DataSync) or external compute, increasing maintenance overhead.

There is a clear need for a **purely serverless, scalable, resumable, and fault-tolerant mechanism** to transfer **multi-GB (10GB+)** files securely to and from SFTP endpoints inside private VPCs.

---

## **Summary of the Invention**

This invention introduces a **Lambda-based adaptive transfer framework** that enables **large file uploads and downloads over SFTP** entirely within AWS Lambda constraints.
The system intelligently divides data into configurable chunks and uses self-invoking Lambdas to complete large transfers seamlessly.

### **Core Innovations**

1. **Lambda Chaining Mechanism**

   * Each invocation transfers a fixed byte range (chunk).
   * Before timeout, Lambda self-invokes asynchronously to continue the transfer from the last checkpoint.
   * Enables continuous processing of arbitrarily large files (>10 GB) within a stateless serverless architecture.

2. **Chunked Streaming via Paramiko**

   * Uses Paramiko’s `file()` streaming APIs for incremental upload/write operations.
   * Supports pipelined writes and manual checkpointing to ensure resumability without retransfer.

3. **Secure Private VPC Integration**

   * Lambda runs in a private subnet and connects directly to AWS Transfer Family SFTP endpoints inside the VPC.
   * Supports host key fingerprint validation and encrypted key handling (from S3, Secrets Manager, or inline KMS-decrypted strings).

4. **Resumable and Fault-Tolerant Design**

   * Maintains state (offset, chunk size, total size) in event payload or DynamoDB.
   * If a failure occurs mid-transfer, the next invocation resumes automatically.

5. **Atomic Completion using Rename Semantics**

   * Uploads to temporary “`.part`” files and performs atomic `rename()` to finalize—ensuring destination integrity and zero-downtime handoff.

6. **Self-Serve Automation Potential**

   * Framework supports dynamic JSON-based configuration, allowing customers or teams to onboard new SFTP workflows without manual coding.

## **Advantages Over Existing Solutions**

| Existing Method    | Drawbacks                                              | New Framework Benefit                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| EC2 / Batch jobs   | Always-on, high cost                                   | 100 % serverless, pay-per-use                       |
| AWS DataSync       | Limited extensibility, costly for small/irregular jobs | Fully customizable and event-driven                 |
| Standard Lambda    | Limited to ~500 MB due to 15-min runtime               | Breaks runtime barrier via chaining and checkpoints |
| Custom FTP clients | Require manual restart on failure                      | Automatic resume and retry with durable state       |

## **Potential Applications**

* Secure data ingestion from partner SFTP servers into S3 data lakes.
* Enterprise self-serve onboarding of file-transfer workflows.
* Automated large-file exports from AWS systems to on-prem partners.
* Hybrid AI/ETL pipelines where files trigger downstream analytics via EventBridge.

---

## **Implementation Environment**

* **AWS Services:** Lambda (Python 3.12), Transfer Family, S3, DynamoDB, EventBridge, Secrets Manager
* **Language/Libraries:** Python (Paramiko, Boto3)
* **Deployment:** Terraform or CloudFormation module with IAM least-privilege roles and optional VPC endpoints.

## **Example Claim (for Patent Review)**

> A method for performing secure, large-scale file transfers using serverless functions, comprising:
> (a) initiating an AWS Lambda instance that transfers a defined byte range of a file over SFTP;
> (b) detecting an approaching runtime threshold and asynchronously invoking a subsequent Lambda instance with updated state;
> (c) repeating steps (a)–(b) until completion; and
> (d) atomically renaming a temporary file to finalize the transfer, thereby enabling uninterrupted multi-GB file movement within a stateless serverless framework.

## **Status**

Prototype completed and validated on AWS with successful 10 GB SFTP upload. Ready for internal review and IP evaluation.


The architecture already incorporates controls for identity and access management, input validation, cross-region resiliency, and observability. Each of these areas has been designed with mitigation strategies in place, validated through pre-production testing or embedded in our CI/CD governance framework.

Scope boundaries, IAM least-privilege enforcement, and operational visibility remain core design principles, ensuring the Self-Serve Portal is secure, reliable, and fully aligned with enterprise standards.
